# SCF-Survey
I chose the variables AGE and DEBT becuase I was interested in the relationship between the two and how the amount of debt would change with age. My hypothesis was that around the ages 25-35 debt would peak. My thought process was that young people usually don't have much debt, and older people have a majority or all of their debt payed off. I thought that people between the ages 25-35 would have the most debt becuase of owing many expensive amounts such as student loans, car payments, and mortgage payments. In reality, my scatter plot showed that debt amounts owed steadily rose from the age of thirty, peaked at the age of 73, and then started to decline. This result was surprising to me becuase I did not expect the highest debt value to be at the age of 73. 73 is higher than the age most Americans retire so I think it would be extremely difficult and stressful to have to keep paying off debt even when you have no income.
